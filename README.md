**Conclusion**
- To navigate between components or pages we can use react-router-dom.  
- "Link" is used to make an element as clickable link.  
- "NavLink" is use when we want to add custom styles to the link such as className attribute.  
- We can use "useNavigate()" from react-router-dom to navigate from one path to another when a special event occured. Such as when a successful login we can navigate to dashboard.
